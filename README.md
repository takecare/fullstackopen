#### Repo structure

Not all parts follow the same structure. In parts 0 to 2 (inclusive) you can find separate apps (sources) for each exercise. From part 3 and onwards you'll see that there is one source for all exercises (cummulative), so all exercises are found in the same sourceset.

In each part you'll find:

- a`sandbox` directory. You can safely ignore this, as it is just a code-along of the part's content;
- an `exercises` directory, containing all exercises.
